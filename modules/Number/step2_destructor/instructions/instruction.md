# MyNumber Exercise
## Destructor and Copy Constructor

The starting point for this exercise is the completion of the previous exercise.  The objective is to complete the class, by adding the necessary destructor.

Having only added the destructor the project will not compile!  This will be due to an attempted double free.  To resolve this issue provide an appropriate copy constructor.
