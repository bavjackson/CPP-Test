# MyNumber Exercise
## Type conversion
The starting point for this exercise is the completion of the previous exercise.  The objective is to complete the class, by adding a type conversion operator. 

Whilst the current version of the class will compile and run with the current code.  Uncomment the use of the type conversion operator within main.  Add an explicit type conversion operator to int.  Maintain const correctness.
