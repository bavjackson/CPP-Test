# MyNumber Exercise
## Constructors

The objective of this sequence of exercises is to complete the class, such that, it compiles and runs.  It is intended that the 'mynumber' type (class) be represented internally by a pointer to int.  Whilst it is recognised that we generally try to avoid the use of raw pointers, the use here is to motivate the necessity to implement various member functions within the class.

Only the minimum work is required to provide constructors and member function (get_val) to return the value stored via the pointer.  Ensure const correctness.

For this step in the exercises, uncomment the commented out lines of code within the main function.  In each step only do sufficient to allow the code within the main function to compile and pass the tests successfully.  Further exercises will require completion of the class.
