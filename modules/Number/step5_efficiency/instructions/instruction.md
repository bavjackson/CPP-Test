# MyNumber Exercise
## Move Constructor and Assignment

The starting point for this exercise is the completion of the previous exercise.  The objective is to complete the class, by adding overloads for efficiency.  To provide for more efficient execution when expiring objects are being passed, overload the copy assignment and copy constructor by providing the move overloads.

The current code within main will remain the same, but provision of the move assignment will mean that the code will run more efficiently.
