# MyNumber Exercise
## Assignment operator

The starting point for this exercise is the completion of the previous exercise.  The objective is to complete the class, by adding an assignment operator.

Whilst the current version of the class will compile and run with the main function, adding additional functionality will cause it to fail.  Uncomment the use of the assignment operator.  The failure will be due to an attempted double free.  To resolve this issue provide an appropriate copy assignment operator.
